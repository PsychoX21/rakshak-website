    "mission_statement": "Team Rakshak is a student UAV team at IIT Bombay dedicated to engineering drones for disaster relief and aerospace innovation. We develop robust Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to support Search and Rescue Operations (SRO) in disaster-stricken areas, surveys, mapping, and wildlife conservation.",
    "engineering_overview": "Team Rakshak designs and builds UAVs entirely from the ground up, integrating airframe design, avionics, and onboard intelligence as a single cohesive system. Our multirotor and fixed-wing platforms are developed in-house, from aerodynamic design and composite manufacturing to electronics integration and control-law tuning. The quadcopter platform that secured 1st place at CUASC was the result of this full-stack approach, combining a custom airframe, in-house electronics, and extensive flight tuning. Since the inception of the team, we have continuously redesigned fixed-wing UAVs, improving aerodynamic efficiency, composite structures, and system reliability each year. Alongside this, we have developed large custom multirotor platforms focused on heavy-payload capability. On the software side, autonomy is implemented entirely in-house, leveraging reinforcement learning-based control and Jetson-powered onboard perception to enable GPS-denied navigation and intelligent decision-making.",
